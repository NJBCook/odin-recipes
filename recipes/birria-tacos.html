    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by making the birria sauce. Toast the dried chiles in a skillet over medium heat until fragrant, about 1-2 minutes on each side.</li>
        <li>Place the toasted chiles in a bowl and cover them with hot water. Let them soak for 15-20 minutes until they are soft.</li>
        <li>In a blender, combine the soaked chiles, beef broth, onion, garlic, tomatoes, apple cider vinegar, ground cumin, dried oregano, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth.</li>
        <li>Strain the sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a large bowl to remove any solids. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Season the beef chuck roast and short ribs (or oxtail) with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Sear the meat on all sides until browned.</li>
        <li>Add the birria sauce to the pot, making sure the meat is fully submerged. If necessary, add more beef broth or water to cover the meat.</li>
        <li>Add the bay leaves to the pot. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 2.5 to 3 hours, or until the meat is tender and shreds easily.</li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the pot and shred it using two forks. Return the shredded meat to the pot and stir to combine with the sauce.</li>
        <li>To make the tacos, heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Dip each corn tortilla in the birria consommé, then place it on the skillet.</li>
        <li>Top each tortilla with shredded meat, chopped white onion, fresh cilantro, and cheese if desired. Fold the tortilla in half and cook until crispy, about 2-3 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Serve the tacos hot, with a side of birria consommé for dipping, lime wedges, salsa, and optional garnishes like avocado slices and radishes.</li>
    </ol>
